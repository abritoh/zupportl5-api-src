Last Updated: December 1, 2024 | Feb 15, 2025

This Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) License Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms governing the use of the ZupportL5 platform ("Service"). ZupportL5 is currently in its development and conceptual phase, and this Agreement reflects its status as a project under active iteration. By accessing or using the Service, you ("User") agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

---

### 1. Project Nature  
ZupportL5 is a platform in its **development/inception phase**, meaning features, functionality, and stability are subject to change. The Service is provided as a conceptual or early-stage project and should not be considered finalized or production-ready.

---

### 2. License Grant  
ZupportL5 grants the User a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license** to access and use the Service for evaluation, testing, and feedback purposes. The Service is provided solely "as-is" for exploratory or experimental use.  

---

### 3. Source Code Privacy and Public Access to Documentation  
Due to the significant effort and intellectual property involved in developing ZupportL5, the **source code remains private**.  
However, to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration, the following resources are made available for **public access**:  
- Documentation  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Javadocs  
- Dependency trees and other generated reports and artifacts
- Most of this documentation has been generated by implementing processor-classes in the source-code, making the application self-descriptive and self-explanatory. 

These publicly available resources are provided to give insight into the project's conceptual and functional architecture without disclosing proprietary implementation details.

---

### 4. Restrictions  
The User agrees not to:  
- (REMOVED SINCE THE REPOSITORY'S VISIBILITY WAS CHANGED TO PUBLIC).
- Disclose proprietary aspects of the Service without written permission.  
- Use the Service in production environments or for critical business purposes.  
- Attempt to bypass or exploit the system for unintended uses.  

---

### 5. Intellectual Property  
The ZupportL5 platform, including its concepts, designs, and any underlying code, is the sole property of ZupportL5. All rights are reserved. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of any intellectual property.

---

### 6. Data Handling  
The Service is intended for testing and experimentation. The User is advised to refrain from uploading sensitive, personal, or confidential data during this phase. ZupportL5 will process any provided data securely but disclaims liability for any data loss, breach, or misuse.  

---

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranties  
- ZupportL5 is provided "as-is" without any warranties, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.  
- ZupportL5 disclaims responsibility for any issues arising from the Service's experimental nature, including downtime, bugs, or feature inconsistencies.  

---

### 8. Feedback and Contributions  
Users are encouraged to provide feedback, suggestions, or insights to improve ZupportL5. Any contributions or suggestions become the intellectual property of ZupportL5, with no obligation to compensate the User.  

---

### 9. Liability Limitation  
ZupportL5 is not liable for damages, losses, or disruptions resulting from the use or inability to use the Service. This limitation applies to indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages, even if advised of their possibility.

---

### 10. Termination  
ZupportL5 reserves the right to terminate access to the Service without notice. The User must cease all use of the Service upon termination.
