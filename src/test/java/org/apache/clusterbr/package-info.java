/**
 * <p>
 * <b>Unit tests</b> and <b>integration tests</b> are two essential testing types 
 * that ensure a program functions correctly, but they focus on different aspects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Unit Test</b></p>
 * <p>
 * Unit tests are like examining the small parts of a machine separately to ensure 
 * each one works. They focus on testing individual pieces of code, such as methods 
 * or functions, without considering their interaction with other system parts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unit tests are lightweight and quick to execute since they don’t depend on 
 * external systems. They are ideal for identifying bugs early when working on 
 * specific parts of the code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Integration Test</b></p>
 * <p>
 * Integration tests are like assembling parts of a machine together to check if 
 * they work as a whole. These tests verify how different components of the system 
 * interact with each other.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unlike unit tests, integration tests often involve many dependencies, such as databases 
 * or external services, to ensure the entire process functions correctly. These tests 
 * take longer to execute because they usually require a full setup, like loading the 
 * application context and establishing database or service connections.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Integration tests are more comprehensive and help detect issues that arise 
 * when different parts of the program collaborate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why Use Both?</b></p>
 * <p>
 * By using both unit tests and integration tests, development-team ensures a robust 
 * and reliable application. Unit tests provide quick feedback for small pieces of 
 * code, while integration tests validate that the overall system works as expected. 
 * Together, they cover the code’s behavior at different levels and increase confidence 
 * in the software's quality.
